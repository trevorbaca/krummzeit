1.  Remove SegmentMaker.make_pitch_handler().
    Use pitch_specifier() factory function instead.

2.  Implement SegmentMaker._set_start_instruments() method.
    Method find first music-maker in each context.
    And then set that instrument at start of segment.

3.  Write test to find redundant instrument attachments.

4.  Add instrument change markup to score.
    So that "bass clarinet" shows up immediately when assigned.
    (Right now appears only at start of next system.)

5.  Add tempo map support for fermatas. And breath marks.

6.  For next score:
    Come up with a semantic way of handling 2/4-type measure inserts.

7.  For next score:
    Make map-making application.
    Implement object model behind.
    Provide ASCII or LateX output.

8.  Extended SegmentMaker with a property to allow [A] to set
    top margin to 0 mm.

9.  ClusterHandler mutates the score.
    So any ClusterHandler should be applied first before other handlers.
    Probably best to enforce by processing all cluster handlers immediately
    after pitch processing (and before other handlers).

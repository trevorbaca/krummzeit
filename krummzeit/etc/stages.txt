[B(9)] and [D(9)] bookend [C]. but [D(9)] procedes differently than [B(9)] and
so [C] does not serve as an interruption to [B(9)] or [D(9)].

"ornamented oboe" (6) heavily territorializes [C]. "bright points"
[C(7)] serves only to reinvigorate or interrupt [C(6)]. [C(7)] introduces
piccolo woodblocks but not xylophone.

"unrestrained strings" [C(10)] constitutes the first appearance of (10) in the
piece. [C(10)] and [C(1)] happen simultaneously. [C(10.2)] punctuates
[C(6-7-6)].

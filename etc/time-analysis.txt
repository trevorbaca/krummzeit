                                 TIME ANALYSIS

delaying the time analysis of [A] until the time behavior of the other sections
is determined.

first region comprises [B1-5]. first attack of the harpsichord announces the
start of [B]. the question of how to manage the introduction of the harpsichord
relative to the piano is answered up front. tempo set to quarter=135. [B5] is a
type of culmination. [B5] marks the first time all seven players play together
after the introduction. time dilates during [B5]. time dilation saturates the
color of (12). sounds like there are two occurrences of [B5] back-to-back.
denote these [B5] and [B5']. the reason for this will be because the oboe will
need a chance to establish its color after prior to time dilation in order to
make the dilation as effective as possible. [B1-5] undergoes a process of
rushing. the harpsichord becomes increasingly dense in [B1-5]. so do the
clarinet, violin and oboe over the course of their entrances staggered after.
at [B5] all four of the instruments of the fifth-octave polyphony of (12.1) are
at a point of articulatory intensity. the viola and cello layers of the slower
third-octave polyphony of (12.2) undergo no such process.

after the introduction of the oboe at [B5] the whole of [B1-5] repeats. denote
these two passes [B1-5] and [B1-5]'. the pitch-classes of all parts in both
(12.1) and (12.2) up-transposed in [B1-5]'. the resulting pitches expressed in
the surface move because of this. it sounds like there is an explicit
accelerando over all of [B1-5] and again over all of [B1-5]'. or perhaps over
[B2-5] and [B2-5]' after the sponged bass drum in (12.3) drops out. the arrival
tempo will be faster than quarter=135. the arrival tempo will have to determine
its relation to the other indications in the inventory. [B1-5]' effects a
subito change of dynamic to piano.

[B5'] follows [B1-5][B1-5]'. [B5'] dilates time. [B5'] moves subito forte from
the matte quiet of [B1-5]'. the change of dynamic intensifies the dilation. the
time dilation of [B5'] includes the lower-register polyphony of (12.2) in the
viola and cello. the time dilation of [B5'] begins to recede at when the viola
and cello fall tacet at the onset of [B6].

next region comprises [B6-11]. the upper-register polyphony of the harpsichord,
clarinet, violin and oboe in (12.1) fall out in a staggered pattern. the
strings introduce the on-the-bridge bowing of (3.5) incrementally. [B6] effects
a return to the prevailing tempo of quarter=135 up from the slowpoint effected
by the dilation in [B5'] before. the draw-down of (12.1) in [B7-10] persists at
quarter=135 inflected neither by accelerandi nor by decelerandi nor by
written-out changes in density of any of the parts. the exit of the sponged
bass drum at the end of [B10] leaves only the on-the-bridge bowing of the three
strings in (3.5) unmixed with any of the other colors. [B11] is a field. [B11]
changes the prevailing tempo by 2:3 down to quarter=90. the metric modulation
is effected during only the on-the-bridge bowing of (3.5). the on-the-bridge
bowing of (3.5) introduces a new rhythmic character. will be determined later.
a fermata governs [B11]. quarter=90 governs the fermata.

next region comprises [B12-16]. time becomes unstuck with the entrance of the
tam at the onset of [B12]. the tam precedes the entrance of the piano clusters.
what is the interval of preentrance? actually it sounds like there is no
interval of preentrance. it sounds like [B12-13] should collapse to a single
stage. the tam and the piano clusters enter at the same time. this subordinates
the tam to the piano clusters. but this is the color should sound this way.
it's clear that the rhythmic character of the piano clusters is strikingly
different than the rhythmic character of materials earlier in [B]. filled-in
pickets articulate the clusters. the remainder of [B12-16] functions to
multiply the points in the string and piano pizzicati of (9.1). a global
accelerando governs [B12-16] or [B13-16]. the irregular articulations of the
picket rhythms in the string layers of (9.1) contrast with the complete picket
rhythms in the clusters. sounds like the accelerando is from quarter=90 back by
3:2 up to quarter=135 in [B15] or [B16] with enough time given to effect the
feeling of the faster tempo. the caesura (described next) then effects a subito
ratcheting down of the tempo from quarter=135 to quarter=108. a tutti caesura
articulates the end of [B16] before the onset of [B17]. the caesura allows the
piano a moment to change modes of production from (3.3) to (9.1). the tam in
(3.4) continues through the caesura even though all the other instruments do
not.

next region comprises [B17-20]. [B17] starts subito in quarter=108. this is the
first time quarter=108 appears in the piece. after the tam exits at the end of
[B17] there's a game at play in [B18-19] when the four layers of the pizzicati
in (9.1) are all present. what characterizes the game? increasing density in
some parts and decreasing density in others. all four players are
tempo-inflected with exponential accelerandi on the order of only a measure or
two at a time. in [B18-19] there's a second case of exact repetition at subito
quieter dynamic (as in [B1-5]'). the way in which the piano brings (9.1) to a
close at the end of [B20] is important but can be left until the time of
writing. when the clarinet and circle-scraped slate enter in [B19] they carry a
new tempo. the tempo is quarter=72. neither accelerandi nor decelerandi govern
[B19-20].

                                     * * *

[C1] begins quarter=108 with the entrance of the oboe. [C1] marks the first
appearance of (6). [C1-9] constitutes a type of staggered and incomplete
presentation of (6) because (6) does not appear in full anywhere in [C]. the
oboe + Eb clarinet in [C1] only foreshadow a fuller presentation of the color.
a pervasive experience of halting is active in [C]. a conductor's fermata
follows the exit of the oboe and Eb clarinet at the end of [C1]. the
circle-scraped slate continues during the fermata. the pointillism the piano,
xylophone and piccolo woodblocks introduce as (7.1) during [C3] is handled as a
series of short cells each followed by a conductor's fermata. the cells equal
only single measures and the fermatas are short. the flautando pedals that the
viola and cello present in [C2-C4] are not subject to this experience of
halting. the flautando spanners and the circle-scraped slate glue together and
form an underlayer. when the ornamented violin writing (6.1) enters in [C4]
halting is suspended and time feels as though it is moving forward
uninterruptedly for the first time in [C]. uninterrupted timeflow continues
throughout [C5-6]. the reintroduction of the piano, xylophony and piccolo
woodblocks at the start of [C7] brings the return of halting. halting persists
throughout [C7-8] but is relinquished in [C9] to effect the exit of (6). global
time-handling. tempo constant at quarter=108 over [C1-3]. accelerando during
[C4-6] from quarter=108 up by 2:1 to quarter=216. tempo games during [C7-8]
with subito tempo changes after almost every fermata. steady tempo at the start
of [C9]. underneath the handling of (6) (10) effects a density decelerando over
[C8-9] culminating in the unrestrained strings (10) in [C10]. quarter=45 at the
start of [C10]. accelerando during [C10-12]. accelerando inflects both the
incredibly loud string chord and piano clusters of [C10-12]. [C] ends at
quater=135.

                                     * * *

the return of (10) during [D7-10] reprises the appearance of (10) in [C7-11].
the harpsichord and string pointillism of (9) during [D1-5] activates a
completely different part of the spectrum between the string writing of [C7-11]
and [D7-10]. [D1-5] starts at quarter=135 and is subject to an uninterrupted
series of undulating chagnes of tempo. the exit of the pointillism at the end
of [D5] regularizes the tempo in preparation for the reappearance of the loud
writing in (10.2) during [D7-10]. there are both pitch and tempo differences
between the loud string writing in [C7-11] and the reappearance of the loud
string writing in [D7-10]. the reappearance in [D7-10] is up-transposed. the
reappearance in [D7-10] is not subject to accelerando. if anything the
reappearance in [D7-10] is subject to decelarando leading to the introduction
of the block oboe at the start of [D9]. the block oboe (2.1) in [D9-11]
constitutes the climax of [D]. the material of the climax is loud and the tempo
of the climax is quarter=45. the staggered entrances of the tam (2.5) and the
bass clarinet (2.4) in [D9] and [D11] serve to shadow and to deepen the oboe.
the climax is effected in the oboe writing itself in [D9-11]. the oboe writing
in [D9-11] is slow but inflected with momentary pullings-forward and momentary
holdings-back. a pronounced decelerando governs [D11-12] and brings [D12] to a
close. timeflow stops phenomenologically at the start of [E].

                                     * * *

the string pedals (3.5) during [E1-5] are on-the-bridge bowing. constant
quarter=36 during [E1-3]. slow accelerando over [E4-7] starting with the viola
glissando and double attack in the piano at the onset of [E4]. subito change of
tempo, rhythmic character, everything for bright piano and xylophone attacks in
[E8]. resumption and completion of accelerando when glissando thicket returns
in [E9]. the end of [E9] attains the bright tempo of [E8]. bright tempo of [E8]
returns and governs [E10-12]. so the tempo of the bright piano and xylophone
points (7) in [E] also governs the appearance of the piano and chromatic string
clusters (1.1) in [E]. feels like the tempo of (7) and (1.1) in [E] is
quarter=108.

                                     * * *

the oboe + Eb clarinet duet articulating [F1-2] adds a transient layer on top
of the piano and chromatic string clusters at the end of [E] and the beginning
of [F]. feels like [F1-2] starts with a sounding fermata in both instruments to
build energy and then rushes forward and causing the (1.1) clusters in [F2] to
carry a faster tempo than the (1.1) clusters in [E10-12]. tempo resets at the
start of [E3]. the return of the glissando thicket in [F4-11] starts at faster
tempo than the first occurrence of the glissando thicket in [E4-9]. so if [E4]
started at quarter=36 and arrived at quarter=108 then [F4] starts at
quarter=72. [F6] will be removed. the return of the bright piano and xylophone
points (7.1) in [F8] picks up where (7.1) left off at the end of [E10] but with
increased density. (7.1) reaches climax as it develops over [E10-15]. the
points in [E10-15] should be especially striking. quarter=90 for the (7.1) over
[E10-13]. subito metric modulation by 3:2 up to quarter=135 at the onset of
[E14-15]. the gradual entrance of the third-octave interweave in the Bb
clarinet, viola and cello in [F13] plants the seeds of a slower tempo
underneath the ongoing brilliance of the points in (7.1). it is also clear that
the third-octave interweave in [F] is actually much lower than that in the
cello. third-octave interweave (4) operates at quarter=45 when it first appears
in [F13] and again over [F15-23]. there's a written-out density increase in the
harpsichord pointillism (9.1) during [F19-20] but no change in tempo.
quarter=45 persists up through [F21]. metric modulation by 8:5 up to quater=72
at the onset of [F22]. quarter=72 governs [F22-23] through to the start of [G].

                                     * * *

[G] starts at quarter=72 with only third-octave polyphony (12.2) in the viola
and cello. perhaps the predominant dynamic of the opening of [G] is quiet for
one of the first times in the piece. this may be true even for the fifth-octave
polyphony (12.1) given to the oboe and Eb clarinet in [G3-7]. it sounds like
the entrance of the harpsichord (2.2) at the onset of [G3] is a counterpoint of
rhythm more than a counterpoint of pitch. in fact it sounds like the
harpsichord in [G] may be confined to a reiterated pitch or to reiteration
confined to a series of slowly ascending or slowly descending pitches selected
quasichromatically. it also sounds like the reiteration present in the
harpsichord in [G] is taken in some way from the ppp snare roll (10.2) in [G].
[G8] constitutes the climax of the unrestrained strings (10.1) in [G] and
perhaps in the piece. so it's clear that a substantial accelerando governs all
of [G8-14]. accelerando begins at quarter=72 and accelerates by 2:1 to
quarter=144.
